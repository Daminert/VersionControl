### Version control:
Version control is a system that tracks changes to project files over time, enabling collaboration between multiple contributors. Maintain a history of edits, promote teamwork, and manage multiple versions of a project, simplifying tasks like reverting to a previous state or merging changes. ### Differences between Git and GitHub:
Git is a distributed version control system and GitHub is a web platform that provides hosting for Git repositories. Simply put, Git handles version control locally on your computer, while GitHub is a remote platform for storing and collaborating on Git repositories.

### Alternative GitHub:
1. GitLab
2. bitbucket
3. Sourceforge

### Git Fetch and Git Pull:
- `git fetch`: Fetch changes from an external repository, but don't automatically merge them into the working branch. - `git pull`: Pull changes from an external repository and automatically merge them into the current branch.

### Git rebase:
Git rebase is a command used to merge changes from one branch to another. Simply put, it helps simplify the commit history by overlaying changes on top of the latest commits from other branches.

The Git rebase command:
``cap
git rebase
````

### Git cherry picks:
Git Cherry-Pick is a command that allows you to apply a specific commit from one branch to another. You can simply pick and choose individual committees that you want to apply to different branches.
